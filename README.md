# svgedit
in-browser SVG editor

Not to be confused with [gedit](https://github.com/GNOME/gedit).

Definitely not done yet.

### Progress:

  * works with LINE, RECT, and ELLIPSE elements
  * moving, resizing, changing solid stroke and fill color (including "none")
  * changing stroke weight
  * altering z-order
  * changing dimensions of entire image

### To Do:

  * functionality for snapping rectangles and ellipses to squares and circles
  * inserting new elements
  * edit "stroke-dasharray" property
  * rotation of elements
  * IMAGE and TEXT elements

### To Do, but it's going to be Hard:
  * PATH elements
  * color gradients
